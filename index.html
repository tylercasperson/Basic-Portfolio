<p>Hi, my name is Tyler Casperson. For the last decade I have worked in various roles as a supply chain manager. Making sure inventory is in stock and ready to use. Coordinating with suppliers and logistics teams to overcome port strikes, Chinese new year, new product launches, tariffs and any issue that prevents the end customer from enjoying their product. The amount of data needed to be analyzed to satisfy the companies goals was made easier by creating databases, and using vba for predictable patterns. I transitioned into full stack development to help modernize my skill set. I have been able to take a 20 hour per month process and turn it into a 3 hour per month project through creating tables, queries, 500 pages of vba code and power shell to automate processes. I am sure I can help find a solution to help with your business.</p>
